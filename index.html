        Steve Jobs was a visionary, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Apple Inc.,
        one of the world's most successful and innovative companies. He was
        known for his passion, creativity, and ability to push boundaries and
        challenge conventional thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Steve Jobs was
        adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He showed an interest in electronics and
        technology from a young age, and while attending Homestead High School,
        he met Steve Wozniak, who would become his friend and future business
        partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1976, Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple Computer in Jobs' parents'
        garage. Their first product, the Apple I, was a personal computer that
        was sold as a DIY kit. The success of the Apple I led to the development
        of the Apple II, which was the first commercially successful personal
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobs was a visionary who believed that technology could change the
        world. He had an eye for design and understood the importance of user
        experience. He was the driving force behind many of Apple's most
        innovative products, including the Macintosh computer, the iPod, the
        iPhone, and the iPad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobs was also known for his charisma and his ability to inspire and
        motivate people. He was a master storyteller and was able to convey his
        passion and enthusiasm for technology in a way that resonated with
        people around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1985, Jobs was fired from Apple, but he didn't let that setback stop
        him. He went on to found NeXT, a computer company that was eventually
        acquired by Apple in 1997. Jobs returned to Apple as CEO, and under his
        leadership, the company became the most valuable publicly traded company
        in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and he passed away on
        October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. His death was a great loss to the
        technology industry and to the world at large. Jobs' legacy lives on
        through the many products he helped create, as well as the lessons he
        taught about innovation, design, and the importance of following your
        passions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his work at Apple, Jobs was also known for his
        philanthropy. He donated millions of dollars to various charitable
        causes, including education, the arts, and medical research. Jobs'
        impact on the world will continue to be felt for generations to come.

        "For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and
        asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do
        what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for
        too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."
